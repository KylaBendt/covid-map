# covid-map

This is a super simple notebook to display a color-coded map of covid cases in the U.S. 

It is designed specifically for viewing with Voila.  Rather than examing the data and walking through the process, it is meant to just create a map that is the 'end product' for the user.  

You can view the Voila rendetion of it in Binder:
